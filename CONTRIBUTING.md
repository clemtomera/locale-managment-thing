# Contributing to the Locales

We welcome contributions to the localization files! Make sure you are in touch with the community on the [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/955738554129063947/1298240970764324914).
Different threads are available for different languages. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

## Repository Structure
You will find the localization files in the `Locales` directory. The reference locale is `en` (English).
Each language has its own subdirectory named according to its locale code (e.g., `es-ES` for Spain Spanish).

## Getting Started
1. **Fork the Repository and Clone it**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account and then clone it to your local machine.
