# Contributing to the Locales

We welcome contributions to the localization files! Make sure you are in touch with the community on the [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/955738554129063947/1298240970764324914).
Different threads are available for different languages. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

## Repository Structure

You will find the localization files in the `Locales` directory. The reference locale is `en` (English).
Each language has its own subdirectory named according to its locale code (e.g., `es-ES` for Spain Spanish).

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository and Clone it**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account and then clone it to your local machine.

1. Keep Your Fork Updated: Regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository to stay updated with the latest changes.

1. Keep the json entries sorted similarly to the reference locale (`en`).
   This helps in maintaining consistency and makes it easier to spot missing entries. Although report audits will help you find missing entries, it's best to keep the files organized from the start.
